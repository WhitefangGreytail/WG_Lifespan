Version 1.3.2-f1, After Dark and Snowfall DLC compatible.

This mod increases the lifespan of people depending on the multiplier set in the XML file. The default is 2 and can be any integer you wish.

At a multiplier of 1, each person lives between 4.5 and 5 years.

A multiplier of 2 will make each person live up to 10 years... and so on.

This mod is meant to be as a replacement for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=409071509]Slow Citizen Aging Configurable[/url]

[h1] Where is the XML file? [/h1]

Default location by OS
Windows = C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Colossal Order\Cities_Skylines
Mac = /Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Colossal Order/Cities_Skylines
Linux = /home/<username>/.local/share/Colossal Order/Cities_Skylines
