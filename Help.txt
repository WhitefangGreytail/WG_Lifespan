Version 1.3.2-f1, After Dark and Snowfall DLC compatible.

This mod increases the lifespan of people depending on the multiplier set in the XML file. The default is 2.

At a multiplier of 1, each person lives up to 5 years of age and will die before they reach 6 years.

A multiplier of 2 will make each person live up to 10 years... and so on.

[h1] Where is the XML file? [/h1]
The XML will be first created when active on exit from a city into the main menu. A file named WG_Lifespan.xml will appear in the default location.

Default location by OS
Windows = C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Colossal Order\Cities_Skylines
Mac = /Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Colossal Order/Cities_Skylines
Linux = /home/<username>/.local/share/Colossal Order/Cities_Skylines


[h1] Known Incompatible Mods [/h1]
WG Resident Rebalance (which will have this mod once updated, so no need to use both)
